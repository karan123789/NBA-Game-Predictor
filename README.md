# NBA-Game-Predictor



In this undertaking, our aim is to forecast the outcomes of NBA basketball games. Our approach involves scraping NBA box scores from the web, followed by processing and cleaning the HTML content using BeautifulSoup. Subsequently, we'll parse these box scores into pandas DataFrames, facilitating their utilization in machine learning tasks. Feature selection will be employed to isolate effective predictors, and a machine learning model will be trained for predictive analysis. Additionally, we'll enhance the model by computing rolling predictors to refine its accuracy and performance.
